*** Edabit challenge 1: Array of Multiples ***
- Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments (num, length) and returns an array of multiples of num up to length.
- Examples:
         arrayOfMultiples(7, 5) ➞ [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]
         arrayOfMultiples(12, 10) ➞ [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]
         arrayOfMultiples(17, 6) ➞ [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]

*** Edabit challenge 2: Converting Objects to Arrays ***
 - Write a function that converts an object into an array, where each element represents a key-value pair. 
 - Examples:
         toArray({ a: 1, b: 2 }) ➞ [["a", 1], ["b", 2]]
         toArray({ shrimp: 15, tots: 12 }) ➞ [["shrimp", 15], ["tots", 12]]
         toArray({}) ➞ []
